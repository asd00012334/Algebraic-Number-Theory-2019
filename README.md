# Algebraic-Number-Theory-2019
Reports and Slides in a course Algebraic Number Theory, taken in 2019. (Disclaimer) These are not formal publications.
- Binary Quadratic Form (with slides): Due to Gauss and Dirichlet, could be thought as concrete instantiations of ideal class group.
- Local Class Field Theory (with slides): Class field theory on local field, main goal for us was to understand the notion of reciprocity maps on non-Archimedean local fields.
